      <h2> Context </h2>
        <p>
          PhD position at Delft University of Technology, 2015-2020.
        </p>
      <h2> Motivation </h2>
        <p>
          Control design for modern safety-critical cyber-physical systems still
          requires significant expert-knowledge, since for general hybrid
          systems with temporal logic specifications there are no constructive
          methods. Nevertheless, in recent years multiple approaches have been
          proposed to automatically synthesize correct-by-construction
          controllers. However, typically these methods either result in
          enormous look-up tables, require online optimization, or are highly
          dependent on expert-knowledge.
        </p>
      <h2> Goal </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project was to propose a novel approach that
          overcomes these limitations, i.e. to propose a framework for automatic
          controller synthesis, capable of synthesizing interpretable
          closed-form controllers for hybrid systems with temporal logic
          specifications, without a heavy reliance on expert-knowledge.
        </p>
      <h2> Approach </h2>
        <p>
          We utilized methods showing great similarities to the human design
          process, namely evolutionary algorithms and counterexample-guided
          inductive synthesis. Specifically, we used genetic programming (GP),
          an evolutionary algorithm capable of evolving entire programs. This
          made it possible to automatically discover the structure of a
          solution. Moreover, it enabled the synthesis of compact and
          interpretable closed-form controllers, circumventing the need for
          look-up tables or online optimization. In combination with GP, we used
          the concept of counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) to
          refine candidate solutions based on counterexamples, until the
          controller is guaranteed to satisfy the desired specification. We have
          explored two CEGIS-based synthesis frameworks, which differ in the
          employed verification paradigms, namely utilizing either
          (co-synthesized) Lyapunov-like functions or reachability analysis.
          Both frameworks result in correct-by-construction compact closed-form
          controllers, where the use of expert-knowledge is optional. Both
          frameworks are capable of synthesizing sampled-data controllers,
          enabling implementation in embedded hardware with limited memory and
          computation power, forming a stepping stone towards faster automation.
          </p>

        <p>
          The overall project was carried out in a collaboration between Delft
          University of Technology, Eindhoven University of Technology, and

            <li> Combining several techniques, including genetic programming,
            reinforcement learning, certificate functions, SMT solvers and
            reachability analysis, to automatically synthesize
            correct-by-construction controllers.
            <li> The implementation of developed algorithms in Mathematica, Matlab and Python.
            <li> The publication of several conference and journal papers.

            Master thesis, in collaboration with Alten Mechatronics, 2014-2015.
          </p>
        <h2> Motivation </h2>
          <p>
            Ball-balancing robots, or Ballbots, are mobile robots that balance
            on top of a single ball. The robot in this project had as its
            primary goal to be an eye-catcher at technical events. As such, the
            primary goal of this project was to go beyond balancing and use the
            full range of motion of the robot. While a linear approach is
            sufficient for balancing, the full range of motion requires a highly
            nonlinear model, dominated by three-dimensional rotations. However,
            parameterizations of these rotations, e.g. Euler angles, can result
            in issues such as a `gimbal lock' or singularities.
          </p>
        <h2> Goal </h2>
          <p>
            The goal of this project was to develop a geometric control
            strategy, i.e. free of parameterization of the rotations, enabling
            the full range of motion of the Ballbot.
          </p>
        <h2> Approach </h2>
          <p>
            Instead of parameterizing rotations, we directly considered the
            rotations on their underlying differential manifolds. We derived a
            new coordinate-free model using screw theory. Based on this model,
            we designed two geometric controllers and a geometric observer,
            which utilized rotational errors that were directly defined on their
            underlying manifolds. Specifically, we designed a computed torque
            controller and a sliding mode controller, that can track the
            attitude of the robot on either the special orthogonal group
            or the 2-sphere. Positional control of the robot was achieved
            through the use of the relation between the desired linear
            acceleration and the attitude of the robot. Finally, initial steps
            were made to implement the controller in the real platform.
          </p>
